					<h2 class="major">Made in France ü•ê</h2>
					<p>I was born in Marseille (France) and spent the first twenty years of my life there.
						I started being interested in Computer Science in highschool.
						I had to program a rover (little vehicle) so that it could get out of a maze without external help.
						I really liked the fact that I could kind of communicate with the machine through the program and be able to
						do cool stuff!
						That is why I then went to the University to study Computer Science.

					<h2 class="major">Polytech Nice-Sophia üë®‚Äçüéì</h2>
					<p> After a two year University degree in Aix-en-Provence(still France), I continued studying software at the
						engineering school Polytech.
						There, I not only learned the fundamentals of software engineering, but also how to work with client
						requirements(which change all the time)
						and how to improve myself outside of school, through numerous personal projects.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<strong>Highlights:</strong>
						<li>I created a UI library in Python(that I never used before) in one week-end.</li>
						<li>My team's innovation project(that I pitched in front of the school) was elected best project among the
							other 15 innovation projects of the school. </li>
						<li>I worked on more than 10 personal projects in 3 years.</li>

					<h2 class="major">Codelitt - Miami üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h2>
					<p>I then moved to Miami(ü§©) where I stayed for a year.
						I worked for a company called Codelitt as a Front-end engineer.
						I learned a lot from my peers. Mainly the mindset to have as an engineer, how to deal with client
						requirements, how to communicate to a team, and how to improve.
						And of course I had a total blast in Miami Beach, my favorite city!
					</p>
					<ul>
						<strong>Highlights:</strong>
						<li>I learned Ruby on Rails in one week.</li>
						<li>I made a presentation to the dev team about good coding practices. </li>
						<li>I learned to make everything pixel perfect for the customer.</li>

					<h2 class="major">Sportbak - Marseille üèÜ</h2>
					<p>After coming back to France I worked for Sportbak, a company creating apps and equipment for sport centers.
						In addition of working on multiple platforms(which improved my UI/UX thinking) I had to manage and train two
						interns,
						as well as keep up with the pressure of meeting the needs of customers. I learned a lot while working there,
						not only on the technical side, but also how a company works, the importance of coherence between different
						teams,
						and having a main vision for the company.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<strong>Highlights:</strong>
						<li>I managed and trained two interns.</li>
						<li>I worked on different platforms (phone, tablet, big screen). </li>
						<li>I learned to see the whole spectrum of an application, the role of design and sales team,
							and not just the development side.</li>

					<h2 class="major">Qualities that help me in my work ‚≠êÔ∏è</h2>
					<p><strong>Curious - </strong> My curiosity makes me want to understand everything. I like having a full
						picture of the project, how it works, how the different elements connect and communicate.
						That helps a lot because I am more aware of certain aspects of the projects
						and it may come handy when talking about client requirements or what needs to be done with other engineers
						of the team. </p>
					<p><strong>Welcoming feedback - </strong> I always like to hear teammates inputs and feedback. I never take
						such things personally and I am always happy to hear what someone think of my work. I like to discuss those
						ideas with anyone, not just other engineers.</p>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section class="panel banner right">
				<div class="content color00-inverted span-3-75">
					<p><strong>Straight to the point - </strong>I always do the most important things first.
						I like to prioritize my work and make sure I meet the most important requirements before starting
						improvements.
						This quality, paired with my curiosity, makes me ask a lot of questions to make sure everything is clear in
						my mind and that I am on the same page with the team.
						Then my work really becomes easy once I know what is important and what is not.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Easy to work with - </strong> "I am not doing that" are words you will never hear from me.
						I am super easy to work with.
						If my mission is to do a particluar thing, I will do it with a smile on my face, as usual.
						I'am always happy to learn a specific technology or language!

					<h2 class="major">When I am not working</h2>
					<p>Yes it happens. Outside of work, I could spend hours reading,
						most of the time non-fiction about anything (quantum physics, health, nutrition, science, history...), as
						long as I learn something, I like it!
						I also love to get out and spend time walking, it feels like a momentary escape from the world and I love
						it.
						Of course my favorite place to walk is Miami Beach, I mean, just look at this...
